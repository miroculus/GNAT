-- TO-DO list --
----------------



- Add a simplified pipe that just returns all potential IDs after only a few 
  filtering steps (immediate context, left-right context, alignment)

- Map to Homologene, UniProt Cluster, etc., instead of a single gene

- A protein version that maps to UniProt

- Alternative NER + candidate assignment: via ML-based NER tool plus a matching
  against the entire dictionary for each recognized name afterwards.
  This would also make it easier to switch to a dictionary with different IDs,
  such as UniProt; HUGO, MGI, ...

- Unify Text.ID and Text.PMID (with getters and setters)

- Simplify the various ContextModel setters that are currently implemented for
  the different gene information types (chromosomal location, GO terms, ...)

- Check SimpleSpeciesNER: should find mouse! and assign it to a Text.taxonIDs

- Out of Memory when running multiple .xml.gz files
