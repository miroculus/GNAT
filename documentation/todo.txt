-- TO-DO list --
----------------



- Add a simplified version that returns all potential IDs

- Map to Homologene, UniProt Cluster, etc., instead of a single gene

- A protein version that maps to UniProt

- Alternative NER + candidate assignment: via ML-based NER tool plus a matching
  against the entire dictionary for each recognized name afterwards.
  This would also make it easier to switch to a dictionary with different IDs,
  such as UniProt; HUGO, MGI, ...
