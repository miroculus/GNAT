Contains some exemplary texts to run pipelines on.


Folder "test"
-------------

The texts/test directory contains five PubMed abstracts that can be used to 
test a local installation. They come together with the gold standard solution
from the BioCreative 2 GN community challenge (see below) in test.solution. An
expected output for running the test in gnat.client.Test is given in test.out.

Folder "test100"
----------------

Contains 100 PubMed abstracts originating from the BioCreative I Task 1B and
BioCreative II, GN task, data sets. While for these original tasks, each 
abstract was annotated for the genes on one species only (human, mouse, fly,
yeast), these 100 abstracts have been re-annotated to include all genes
mentioned therein [2]. The gold standard is in "test100.genelist", the script
"bc2scoring.py" is the official BioCreative II GN task scoring script [1].
