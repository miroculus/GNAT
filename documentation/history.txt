Version history for GNAT code and resources

1.0 to 1.1
----------

Resources:
- switched S. cer and E. coli genes to different NCBI taxa; due to a change in 
  Entrez Gene that moved all S. cer genes from 4932 to 559292 (S. cer. S288c) 
  and all E. coli genes from 562 to 511145 (E. coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655).
  - added these two dictionaries
  - changed entries in gene to taxon table (GR_Origin)
- added test data set from Hakenberg et al., Bioinformatics, 2008:
  100 abstracts from BioCreative I+II annotated for all genes from all species
  see texts/test100
- updated documentation, more details on steps to setup (MySQL driver,JDOM,..) 
  and test
  
Code---additions, changes:
- added class client.JustAnnotate - simple local run that prints results in 
  BioCreative format
- changed the DefaultSpeciesNER filter to return a list of each species mention
- changed Text to store all species mentions -> helps counting how many species
  occur at which frequencies
- added SpeciesFrequency filter that decides on a species by checking the most
  frequently mentioned species in a text
- updated UnspecificNameFilter

Bug fixes:
- when reading abstracts, lines where concatenated w/o white space, so at 
  NER could fail within accidentally concatenated words b/c it requires
  word boundaries left+right of a gene and species
