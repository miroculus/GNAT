-- Third-party libraries used in GNAT --
----------------------------------------

GNAT relies on several third-party Java libraries that have to be obtained
prior to running client or server.

BRICS -- a DFA/NFA (finite-state automata) implementation
Webpage: http://www.brics.dk/automaton/
As several changes were required to make this work the way we need to represent
each gnat.server.dictionary.Dictionary, the source code is included here, see
package brics.automaton.*

MySQL Connector/JDBC

Jar files:
