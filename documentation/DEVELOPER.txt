Notes for developers
--------------------


1) GNAT and BANNER

GNAT provides a filter to validate gene candidate comparing them to mentions
recognized by BANNER (banner.sourceforge.net). Apparently there are some
inconsistencies (=changes in the BANNER's API), which can be resolved by
downloading the latest BANNER code from Sourceforge, instead of the latest JAR
that is distributed.
