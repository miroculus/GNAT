-- GNAT installation --
-----------------------

1) Download several files
2) Create and fill a relational database
3) Edit property files
4) Run a test
5) Run GNAT on your documents



1) Download several files
-------------------------

Download the following files from Sourceforge into a new folder:
- gnat.tar.gz         - GNAT binaries for client and server, configurations,
                        data, scripts, test cases needed for GNAT
- gnat_dictionaries.tar.gz - example dictionaries for human, mouse, and fruit fly,
                             genes; and for GeneOntology and MeSH term recognition
- gnat_sql_data.tar.gz     - gene information for GNAT
Unless stated otherwise, the files are always downward-compatible, so make sure 
to download the newest version of each file, even though the version numbers 
might not match between the three different files (for example, SQL version
1.2 and gnat.tar.gz version 1.1 will be okay).

Unzip all *.gz files into the same folder. The following sub-directories
will be created:
- config/         - various configuration files
- data/           - static data required to run GNAT
- dictionaries/   - data for NER dictionaries
- documentation/  - readme files
- lib/            - required libraries such as gnat.jar; you can store other
                    libraries such as mysql.jar (see below) here as well.
                    * if this directory is not present, create it and move
                      gnat.jar and other libraries here
- scripts/        - example scripts to generate and start dictionaries, run
                    GNAT, etc.
                    * you might need to change the class path in these scripts
- sql/            - data that need to be loaded into a DB, see below
- texts/          - example texts and tests to process by GNAT
as well as two property files (isgn_properties.xml and service_properties.xml).
Make sure that all these sub-directories reside within the same folder.


2) Create and fill a relational database
----------------------------------------

Load the SQL data into a relational database, such as MySQL.
a) Set up a local database if none is already running
b) Create a schema for GNAT data, for instance, called "GNAT"
   In the MySQL command prompt, for example, run
   > create database GNAT;
c) Load all the SQL files into that schema
   Note: later versions of GNAT have all tables in a single SQL dump file
   Example in MySQL:
   - change to the sql/ directory
   - start the MySQL command prompt, usually by entering something like
     > mysql -h MY-DB-SERVER -u MY-USERNAME -p
     where MY-DB-SERVER is the URL for you database server (could be 
     'localhost' as well) and MY-USERNAME is your user name; you will then be
     prompted for your password
   - change into the new schema
     > use GNAT;
   - run the command
     > source gr_goterm.sql;
     to load the GOTerm table; and similar for all other *.sql import scripts.
   - or in later versions (1.2+) run the single command
     > source gnat_sql_data-1.2.sql;
     using the appropriate version number in the file name.
   For MySQL, you can simply run
     > source mysqlImportAll.sql;
   to import all SQL files at once (provided only with early versions of GNAT).
   Again, you need to be in the sql/ directory!
   This step will take several minutes to complete.
d) Download a JDBC driver for that database from the respective website, such
   as mysql-connector-java-5.1.17-bin.jar, and move it to the lib/ directory.
   For MySQL, the website (Aug 2012) is
     http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
e) Change the database-related settings in isgn_properties.xml, see below
f) The scripts provided with GNAT assume a JDBC driver is stored as
     lib/mysql-connector.jar
   If you are using a different version or a different driver, make sure to
   change the startup and test scripts, for instance,
     scripts/startGeneService.sh
     scripts/testLocalPipeline.sh 
   Accordingly: change the "-cp ..." command line parameter from
     "-cp lib/gnat.jar:lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.17-bin.jar"
   into 
     "-cp lib/gnat.jar:<new-path>/<new-jdbc-driver>.jar"
   Alternatively, you can simply rename your freshly downloaded version of the
   JDBC driver into "mysql-connector.jar", again making sure it reside in the
   lib/ folder within GNAT.


3) Edit property files
----------------------

Edit the properties file "isgn_properties.xml"
- change the database access information according to your local configuration:
  change entries for dbUser, dbPass, dbAccessUrl, and dbDriver
  Examples:
    dbAccessUrl: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/GNAT
    dbDriver:    org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver
- change the local and remote URLs for your services
  entries:
    dictionaryServer - the server URL (without port) or 'localhost' that hosts
                       your remote dictionaries (if any); this would be, for
                       instance, the server on which you launch step 4a) below;
                       if you plan to use more than one server for different
                       dictionaries, please adjust the settings in
                         config/geneNerDictionaryServers.txt
    dictionaryServerGO - the server that hosts the specific GO and MeSH term
                       dictionary tagger (could be different from the other
                       dictionaries)
    gnatServiceUrl   - the URL to the GNAT remote services, if you plan to use
                       those
    geneRepositoryService - needed if using a gene repository rather than local
                       DB to host information on genes
    linnaeusUrl      - URL to an instance of LINNAEUS for species recognition 



4) Run a test
-------------

a) Start the human gene recognition dictionary locally
   - see scripts/startHumanDict.sh for an example of how to start a dictionary
   - you need to provide the path to the human (9606) dictionary directory,
   - as well as a port on which the server will run
   - needs around 2GB of memory
   - needs around 1min to start
   - after successful startup, the dictionary will display a message like
     "Startup in x seconds."
b) If you chose a port other than given in the example shell script ("56001"),
   edit data/taxonToServerPort.txt and change the entry for "9606" accordingly
c) You can also run the dictionary on a different machine; in this case, add
   the machine's address and port to the entry for 9606, in the format
   "server:port". Example:
     9606[TAB]myserver.com:5555[TAB]optional comment
d) Do the same a-c) to launch the GeneOntology and MeSH term dictionary,
   - see scripts/startGoMeshTerms.sh
d) Run the test with scripts/testLocalPipeline.sh
e) The test should return the message "Test okay!" upon completion



5) Run GNAT on your documents
-----------------------------

Please see the "Main classes" section in README.txt on how to run GNAT on your
own set of documents.
