-- GNAT installation --
-----------------------

1) Download several files
2) Create and fill a relational database
3) Edit property files
4) Run a test



1) Download several files
-------------------------

Download the following files from Sourceforge into a new folder:
- gnat.tar.gz         - GNAT binaries for client and server, configurations,
                        data, scripts, test cases needed for GNAT
- dictionaries.tar.gz - example dictionaries for human, mouse, and fruit fly,
                        genes; and for GeneOntology and MeSH term recognition
- sql.tar.gz          - gene information for GNAT

Unzip all *.gz files into the same folder. The following sub-directories
will be created:
- config/         - various configuration files
- data/           - static data required to run GNAT
- dictionaries/   - data for NER dictionaries
- documentation/  - readme files
- lib/            - required libraries such as gnat.jar; you can store other
                    libraries such as mysql.jar (see below) here as well.
                    * if this directory is not present, create it and move
                      gnat.jar and other libraries here
- scripts/        - example scripts to generate and start dictionaries, run
                    GNAT, etc.
                    * you might need to change the class path in these scripts
- sql/            - data that need to be loaded into a DB, see below
- texts/          - example texts and tests to process by GNAT
and two property files (isgn_ and service_properties.xml).



2) Create and fill a relational database
----------------------------------------

Load the SQL data into a relational database, such as MySQL.
a) set up a local database if none is already running
b) create a schema for GNAT data, for instance, called "GNAT"
c) load all the SQL files into that schema
   Example in MySQL:
   - change to the sql/ directory
   - start the MySQL command prompt
   - run the command
     > source gr_goterm.sql;
   to load the GOTerm table.
   For MySQL, you can also run
     > source mysqlImportAll.sql;
   to import all SQL files at once.
   Again, you need to be in the sql/ directory!
d) download a JDBC driver for that database from the respective website, such
   as mysql-connector-java-5.1.7-bin.jar, and move it to the lib/ directory
e) change the database-related settings in isgn_properties.xml, see below
f) The scripts provided assume a JDBC driver is stored as
     lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.7-bin.jar
   If you are using a different version or a different driver, make sure to
   change the startup and test scripts, for instance,
     scripts/startGeneService.sh
     scripts/testLocalPipeline.sh 
   accordingly: change the "-cp ..." command line parameter from
     "-cp lib/gnat.jar:lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.7-bin.jar"
   into 
     "-cp lib/gnat.jar:<new-path>/<new-jdbc-driver>.jar"


3) Edit property files
----------------------

Edit the properties file "isgn_properties.xml"
- change the database access information according to your local configuration:
  change entries for dbUser, dbPass, dbAccessUrl, and dbDriver
  Examples:
    dbAccessUrl: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/GNAT
    dbDriver:    org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver



4) Run a test
-------------

a) Start the human gene recognition dictionary locally
   - see scripts/startHuman.sh for an example of how to start a dictionary
   - you need to provide the path to the human (9606) dictionary directory,
   - as well as a port on which the server will run
   - needs around 2GB of memory
   - needs around 1min to start
   - after successful startup, the dictionary will display a message like
     "Startup in x seconds."
b) If you chose a port other than given in the example shell script ("56001"),
   edit data/taxonToServerPort.txt and change the entry for "9606" accordingly
c) You can also run the dictionary on a different machine; in this case, add
   the machine's address and port to the entry for 9606, in the format
   "server:port". Example:
     9606[TAB]myserver.com:5555[TAB]optional comment
d) Run the test with scripts/testLocalPipeline.sh
e) The test should return the message "Test okay!" upon completion
