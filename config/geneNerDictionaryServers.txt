# A mapping of DictionaryServers for gene NER from taxon to server address and port.
# Alternatively to an address, the name of a gnat.filter.Filter can be given, including the package.
# 
# If a species is mapped by multiple entries, all corresponding servers will be called, one after the other.
# An entry 'ALL' for the taxon ID means that this Server/Filter will be called for all species; if a particular
# taxon is also given, both servers will be called for that species.
# An entry 'OTHER' for the taxon ID means that the given server will be called if no other mapping for a particular species exists.
#
# Thus, if you are proving your own NER for a certain species, but want to use GNAT for all others, you should have an entry
# for 'OTHER', mapped to 'gnat.filter.ner.GnatServiceNer'; plus an entry for your own dictionary, mapping its species to a
# server address:port or your own Filter class.
