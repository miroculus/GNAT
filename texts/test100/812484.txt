Kynurenine-H3 transport and conversion to 3-hydroxykynurenine were studied
in organ culture using the Malpighian tubules and developing eyes from
wild type and the eye color mutants w, st, ltd, ca, and cn of Drosophila
melanogaster. Malpighian tubules from wild type have the ability to
concentrate kynurenine and convert it to 3-hydroxykynurenine. The tubules
from w, st, ltd, and ca are deficient in the ability to transport
kynurenine, as are the eyes of the mutants w, st, and ltd. This defect in
kynurenine transport provides a physiological explanation for the
phenotypic properties of the mutants. The relationship of these
measurements to previous observations on these eye color mutants is
discussed and the transport defect hypothesis is consistently supported.
We have concluded that several of the eye color mutants in Drosophila are
transport mutants.
