We describe here genetic interactions between mutant alleles of
Actin-NonComplementing (ANC) genes and actin (ACT1) or actin-binding
protein (SAC6, ABP1, TPM1) genes. The anc mutations were found to exhibit
allele-specific noncomplementing interactions with different act1
mutations. In addition, mutant alleles of four ANC genes (ANC1, ANC2, ANC3
and ANC4) were tested for interactions with null alleles of actin-binding
protein genes. An anc1 mutant allele failed to complement null alleles of
the SAC6 and TPM1 genes that encode yeast fimbrin and tropomyosin,
respectively. Also, synthetic lethality between anc3 and sac6 mutations,
and between anc4 and tpm1 mutations was observed. Taken together, the
above results strongly suggest that the ANC gene products contribute to
diverse aspects of actin function. Finally, we report the results of tests
of two models previously proposed to explain extragenic
noncomplementation.
