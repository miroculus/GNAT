The common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gamma(c)) is an indispensable
subunit for the formation of lymphoid-related cytokine receptors,
including IL-7 and IL-15 receptors, that mediate nonredundant or critical
signals for the differentiation of T and B cells and natural killer (NK)
cells, respectively. We introduced the bcl-2 transgene driven by E mu or
H-2K promoters into gamma(c)-deficient mice that lack all three lymphoid
subclasses. The forced expression of Bcl-2 restored all stages of T
lymphopoiesis, but not B or NK cell development, indicating that a primary
function of gamma(c)-mediated signals in the T lineage might be to
maintain cell survival. Therefore, the development of T, B, and NK cells
may be influenced by distinct intracytoplasmic signaling cascades that are
activated by coupling of gamma(c)-related receptors.
