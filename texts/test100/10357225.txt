Previous work has provided conclusive support for a role of various
protein kinases in processes underlying learning and memory formation.
While these processes are not yet established in full detail, it is
interesting to entertain the idea of protein phosphatases being involved
in such mechanisms as well. Recent advances in this respect have provided
preliminary support of this view. From the pharmacological as well as the
transgenic analysis, it appears that especially the
calcineurin/inhibitor-1 cascade plays an important role in the transition
of intermediate-term into long-term memory formation.
