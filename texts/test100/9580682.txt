The zinc finger protein Rme1p is a negative regulator of the meiotic
activator IME1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Prior studies have shown that
Rme1p binds in vitro to a site near nt -2030 in the IME1 upstream region,
but a genomic mutation in that site has little effect on repression of
IME1 . To identify Rme1p binding sites in vivo , we have examined the
binding of Rme1p to genomic sites through in vivo footprinting. We show
that Rme1p binds to two sites in the IME1 upstream region, near nt -1950
and -2030. Mutations in both binding sites abolish repression of
chromosomal IME1 by Rme1p, whereas a mutation in either single site causes
partial derepression. Therefore, both Rme1p binding sites are essential
for repression of IME1 . Prior studies have shown that repression by Rme1p
depends upon RGR1 and SIN4 , which specify RNA polymerase II mediator
subunits that are required for normal nucleosome density. We find that
RGR1 and SIN4 are not simply required for Rme1p to bind to DNA in vivo .
These results suggest that Rme1p functions directly as a repressor of IME1
and that Rgr1p and Sin4p are required for DNA-bound Rme1p to exert
repression.
