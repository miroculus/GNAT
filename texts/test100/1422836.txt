Behavioral effects of murine interferon-alpha and -gamma were explored
using a well-characterized system for detecting interferon effects. In
addition, the effectiveness of human interferon-alpha was determined.
Mouse gamma-interferon decreased activity and food-related behavior,
effects that were similar to the effects of mouse alpha-interferon.
Equivalent doses of the human preparation had little effect upon these
measures in mice. Some common action of alpha- and gamma-interferon is
likely responsible for the similar effects seen for the two molecules. Low
effectiveness of the human preparation in mice was predicted due to the
differences in receptors between species.
