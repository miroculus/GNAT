DPB11, a gene that suppresses mutations in two essential subunits of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase II(epsilon) encoded by POL2 and
DPB2, was isolated on a multicopy plasmid. The nucleotide sequence of the
DPB11 gene revealed an open reading frame predicting an 87-kDa protein.
This protein is homologous to the Schizosaccharomyces pombe rad4+/cut5+
gene product that has a cell cycle checkpoint function. Disruption of
DPB11 is lethal, indicating that DPB11 is essential for cell
proliferation. In thermosensitive dpb11-1 mutant cells, S-phase
progression is defective at the nonpermissive temperature, followed by
cell division with unequal chromosomal segregation accompanied by loss of
viability.dpb11-1 is synthetic lethal with any one of the dpb2-1, pol2-11,
and pol2-18 mutations at all temperatures. Moreover, dpb11 cells are
sensitive to hydroxyurea, methyl methanesulfonate, and UV irradiation.
These results strongly suggest that Dpb11 is a part of the DNA polymerase
II complex during chromosomal DNA replication and also acts in a
checkpoint pathway during the S phase of the cell cycle to sense stalled
DNA replication.
