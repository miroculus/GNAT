Blastocyst implantation is accompanied by dramatic changes in gene
expression to facilitate decidualization and remodelling of uterine
architecture. Stanniocalcin (STC) is a new mammalian polypeptide hormone
with roles in ion transport, reproduction and development. Here we report
dynamic changes in STC mRNA and protein distributions in the early
post-implantation mouse uterus. In the non-pregnant state, STC gene
expression was confined to the uterine lumenal epithelium. Following
implantation STC gene expression shifted to mesometrial stromal cells
bordering the uterine lumen. Between E6.5-E8.5 expression shifted once
more to cells of the mesometrial lateral sinusoids, and then declined
thereafter. Intriguingly immunoreactive STC did not entirely co-localize
with areas of high STC gene activity and instead appeared to accumulate in
presumptive targets of the hormone (uterine epithelium, stromal and
decidual cells, trophoblastic giant cells). STC is only the fourth gene
identified as being expressed mesometrially in the uterus following
implantation.
