In Drosophila the products of the seminal fluid stimulate oviposition and
suppress remating in the female. Of all the accessory gland peptides
(Acp's) involved in these two responses, the sex-peptide (coded by the
Acp70A gene) is among the best characterized at the functional level. A
1.2-kb fragment encompassing the Acp70A gene of nine lines from a natural
population of D. melanogaster and one allele of D. sechellia was sequenced
to study the forces shaping nucleotide variation within and between
species. The coding region of D. simulans and D. mauritiana was also
sequenced. A Ser to Ala replacement polymorphism at the last position of
the signal peptide was detected in D. melanogaster. The Ser and Ala
alleles are at intermediate frequencies. The level of nucleotide variation
is lower for the derived Ala allele, which is compatible with a recent
origin and an increase in frequency due to positive selection. Variation
at the 5' flanking region is structured in two major highly differentiated
haplotypes, whose distribution does not conform to neutral expectations.
Selective and/or historical factors could contribute to the observed
overall patterning of nucleotide variation at the Acp70A region.
