Growth hormone (GH) is important for skeletal growth as well as for a
normal bone metabolism in adults. The skeletal growth and adult bone
metabolism was studied in mice with an inactivated growth hormone receptor
(GHR) gene. The lengths of femur, tibia, and crown-rump were, as expected,
decreased in GHR-/- mice. Unexpectedly, GHR-/- mice displayed
disproportional skeletal growth reflected by decreased femur/crown-rump
and femur/tibia ratios. GHR-/- mice demonstrated decreased width of the
growth plates in the long bones and disturbed ossification of the proximal
tibial epiphysis. Furthermore, the area bone mineral density (BMD) as well
as the bone mineral content (BMC)/body weight were markedly decreased in
GHR-/- mice. The decrease in BMC in GHR-/- mice was not due to decreased
trabecular volumetric BMD but to a decreased cross-sectional cortical bone
area In conclusion, GHR-/- mice demonstrate disproportional skeletal
growth and markedly decreased bone mineral content.
