The BMP-like signaling mediated by the ligands Dpp and Gbb is required to
reinforce the development of most veins in the Drosophila wing. However,
the formation of the cross veins is especially sensitive to reductions in
BMP-like signaling. We show here that the formation of the definitive
cross veins occurs after the initial specification of the longitudinal
veins in a process that requires localized BMP-like activity. Since Dpp
and Gbb levels are not detectably higher in the early phases of cross vein
development, other factors apparently account for this localized activity.
Our evidence suggests that the product of the crossveinless 2 gene is a
novel member of the BMP-like signaling pathway required to potentiate Gbb
of Dpp signaling in the cross veins. crossveinless 2 is expressed at
higher levels in the developing cross veins and is necessary for local
BMP-like activity. The Crossveinless 2 protein contains a putative signal
or transmembrane sequence, and a partial Von Willebrand Factor D domain
similar to those known to regulate the formation of intramolecular and
intermolecular bonds. It also contains five cysteine-rich domains, similar
to the cysteine-rich domains found in Chordin, Short Gastrulation and
Procollagen that are known to bind BMP-like ligands. These features
strongly suggest that Crossveinless 2 acts extracelluarly or in the
secretory pathway to directly potentiate Dpp or Gbb signaling.
