DNA damage induced mutations arising during the course of translesion
replication are likely to be an important contributory cause in the
development of many cancers. In budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a
good model system with which to investigate this process, mutagenesis is
associated with the RAD6 repair pathway and depends on the functions of
the REV1, REV3 and REV7 genes. The Rev3 and Rev7 proteins are subunits of
a new type of DNA polymerase, called DNA polymerase zeta, that appears to
carry out translesion replication, but no other repair, recombination or
replication function. Pol zeta replicates past a T-T cyclobutane dimer
with a higher efficiency than yeast pol alpha, is less prone than this
enzyme to insert an incorrect nucleotide and is more efficient at
elongating from a mismatched terminus. Rev1 protein is a terminal
nucleotidyl transferase that inserts dCMP opposite template G, A and
abasic sites. Types of mutations induced during translesion replication
appear to depend largely on lesion structure, but the frequency and
accuracy of bypass also depend on replication conditions. Inhibition of
the activity or expression of pol zeta may be clinically useful for
patients undergoing cancer therapy or for those with a familial
predisposition to cancer.
