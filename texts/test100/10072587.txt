Cloning of a novel gene (ING1L) homologous to ING1, a candidate tumor suppressor.

The ING1 gene encodes p33(ING1), a putative tumor suppressor for neuroblastomas and breast cancers, which has been shown to cooperate with p53 in controlling cell proliferation. We have isolated a novel human gene, ING1L, that potentially encodes a PHD-type zinc-finger protein highly homologous to p33(ING1). Fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation-hybrid analyses assigned ING1L to human chromosome 4. Both ING1 and ING1L are expressed in a variety of human tissues, but we found ING1L expression to be significantly more pronounced in tumors from several colon-cancer patients than in normal colon tissues excised at the same surgical sites. Although the significance of this observation with respect to carcinogenesis remains to be established, the data suggest that ING1L might be involved in colon cancers through interference with signal(s) transmitted through p53 and p33(ING1).
