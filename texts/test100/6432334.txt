We have surveyed expression of the six Drosophila actin genes during
ontogeny. Unique portions of cloned actin genes were used to monitor
levels of respective mRNAs in developmentally staged whole organisms and
dissected body parts. We find that each gene is transcribed to form
functional mRNA, which accumulates with a distinct pattern. Two of the
genes, act5C and act42A, are expressed in undifferentiated cells and
probably encode cytoplasmic actins. Act57A and act87E are expressed
predominantly in larval, pupal, and adult intersegmental muscles; act88F
in muscles of the adult thorax; and act79B in the thorax and leg muscles.
These composite data define three main patterns of actin gene expression
which are correlated with changing Drosophila morphology, particularly
muscle differentiation and reorganization.
