hedgehog is a segment polarity gene necessary to maintain the proper
organization of each segment of the Drosophila embryo. We have identified
the physical location of a number of rearrangement breakpoints associated
with hedgehog mutations. The corresponding hh RNA is expressed in a series
of segmental stripes starting at cellular blastoderm in the posterior
portion of each segment. This RNA is localized predominantly within nuclei
until stage 10, when the localization becomes primarily cytoplasmic.
Expression of hh RNA in the posterior compartment is independent of most
other segment polarity genes, including en, until the late extended
germ-band stage (stage 11). Sequence analysis of the hedgehog locus
suggests the protein product is a transmembrane protein, which may,
therefore, be directly involved in cell-cell communication.
