We have cloned a cDNA that codes for mouse liver-specific transporter-1,
mouse lst-1. The cDNA is comprised of 3296 base pairs and it contains a
coding sequence for a protein of 689 amino acids with 12 putative
transmembrane domains. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse lst-1
shares 64 and 77% identities with the reported human and rat lsts,
respectively. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that mouse lst-1 mRNA is
expressed exclusively in liver. We also report here the structural
organization of the mouse lst-1 gene as the first evidence for the
structure of a gene encoding an lst. The mouse lst-1 gene spans
approximately 60 kbp in length and consists of 16 exons, including two
noncoding exons. All the introns are flanked by GT-AG consensus splice
sequences. 5'-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) analyses demonstrate
three splice variant mRNAs involving the noncoding exon 2 and exon 3. The
5'-flanking region of the gene contains consensus CAAT and TATA boxes and
several potential binding sites for transcription factors for CAAT
enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) and hepatocyte nuclear factors
(HNF-3beta, HFH-1, and HFH-2), transcription factors important for
liver-specific gene expression.
