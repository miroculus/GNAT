The primary structures of interferon (IFN)-induced guanylate-binding
proteins (GBPs) were deduced from cloned human and murine cDNAs. These
proteins contained only two of the three sequence motifs typically found
in GTP/GDP-binding proteins. The N(T)KXD motif, which is believed to
confer guanine specificity in other nucleotide-binding proteins, was
absent. Nevertheless, the IFN-induced GBPs exhibited a high degree of
selectivity for binding to agarose-immobilized guanine nucleotides. An
interesting feature of IFN-induced GBPs is that they strongly bound to GMP
agarose in addition to GDP and GTP agaroses but failed to bind to ATP
agarose and all other nucleotide agaroses tested. Both GTP and GMP, but
not ATP, competed for binding of murine GBP-1 to agarose-immobilized GMP.
The IFN-induced GBPs thus define a distinct novel family of proteins with
GTP-binding activity. We further demonstrate that human and murine cells
contain at least two genes encoding IFN-induced GBPs. The cloned murine
cDNA codes for GBP-1, an IFN-induced protein previously shown to be absent
from mice of Gbp-1b genotype.
