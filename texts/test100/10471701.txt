Rad23 is a member of a novel class of proteins that contain unprocessed
ubiquitin-like (UbL) domains. We showed recently that a small fraction of
Rad23 can form an interaction with the 26S proteasome. Similarly, a small
fraction of Rpn10 is a component of the proteasome. Rpn10 can bind
multiubiquitin chains in vitro, but genetic studies have not clarified its
role in vivo. We report here that the loss of both Rad23 and Rpn10 results
in pleiotropic defects that are not observed in either single mutant.
rad23Delta rpn10Delta displays slow growth, cold sensitivity, and a
pronounced G2/M phase delay, implicating overlapping roles for Rad23 and
Rpn10. Although rad23Delta rpn10Delta displays similar sensitivity to DNA
damage as a rad23Delta single mutant, deletion of RAD23 in rpn10Delta
significantly increased sensitivity to canavanine, a phenotype associated
with an rpn10Delta single mutant. A mutant Rad23 that is unable to bind
the proteasome ((DeltaUbL)rad23) does not suppress the canavanine or
cold-sensitive defects of rad23Delta rpn10Delta, demonstrating that
Rad23/proteasome interaction is related to these effects. Finally, the
accumulation of multiubiquitinated proteins and the stabilization of a
specific proteolytic substrate in rad23Delta rpn10Delta suggest that
proteasome function is altered.
