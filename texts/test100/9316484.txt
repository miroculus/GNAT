The role of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in murine lung
inflammation was examined in vivo. Ovalbumin (Ova)-sensitized and
-challenged ICAM-1-deficient (KO) mice had decreased accumulation of
leukocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with wild-type
(WT) mice. Lung tissue inflammation was also attenuated. Ova immunization
and challenge produced equivalent plasma levels of Ova-specific
immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and higher concentrations of IgE in KO versus WT
mice. Ova-dependent induction of cytokines in vitro, as measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was impaired in splenocytes from KO
mice compared with the comparable release of interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-10
from anti-CD3-stimulated WT and KO splenocytes. Methacholine-induced
increases in trapped gas in lungs of Ova-sensitized and -challenged WT
mice were greater than those of KO mice. The activation of lung tissue
nuclear factor-kappa B was diminished in KO mice after Ova provocation.
This suggests that ICAM-1 was important for activation of the inflammatory
cascade leading to the recruitment of leukocytes but was not critical for
the generation of antibody responses in vivo.
