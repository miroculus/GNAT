Genes for small heat shock proteins (hsp27 to hsp22) are activated in late
third-instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster in the absence of heat
stress. This regulation has been simulated in cultured Drosophila cells in
which the genes are activated by the addition of ecdysterone. Sequence
elements (HERE) involved in ecdysterone regulation of the hsp27 and hsp23
genes have been defined by transfection studies and have recently been
identified as binding sites for ecdysterone receptor. We report here that
the hsp27 and hsp23 genes are regulated differently by ecdysterone. The
hsp27 gene is activated rapidly by ecdysterone, even in the absence of
protein synthesis. In contrast, high-level expression of the hsp23 gene
begins only after a lag of about 6 h, is dependent on the continuous
presence of ecdysterone, and is sensitive to low concentrations of protein
synthesis inhibitors. Transfection experiments with reporter constructs
show that this difference in regulation is at the transcriptional level.
Synthetic hsp27 or hsp23 HERE sequences confer hsp27- or hsp23-type
ecdysterone regulation on a basal promoter. These findings indicate that
the hsp27 gene is a primary, and the hsp23 gene is mainly a secondary,
hormone-responsive gene. Ecdysterone receptor is implied to play a role in
the regulation of both genes.
