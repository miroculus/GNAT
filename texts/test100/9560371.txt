Recombinational repair of a site-specific, double-strand DNA break (DSB)
results in increased reversion frequency for nearby mutations. Although
some models for DSB repair predict that newly synthesized DNA will be
inherited equally by both the originally broken chromosome and the
chromosome that served as a template, the DNA synthesis errors are almost
exclusively found on the chromosome that had the original DSB (introduced
by the HO endonuclease). To determine whether mismatch repair acts on the
template chromosome in a directed fashion to restore mismatches to the
initial sequence, these experiments were repeated in mismatch
repair-defective (pms1, mlh1, and msh2) backgrounds. The results suggest
that mismatch repair is not responsible for the observed bias.
