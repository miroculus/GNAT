Ecdysone and insect immunity: the maturation of the inducibility of the
diptericin gene in Drosophila larvae.

The developmental analysis of the inducibility of the Drosophila
diptericin gene promoter as a response to septic injury shows an important
increase in the response during the third larval instar leading to a
maximum in late larvae and early prepupae. This increase, or maturation,
is temporally correlated with known ecdysone induced events of the
salivary gland and we now present evidence, using wild type and mutant
larvae, that it does indeed depend upon ecdysone. The response remains
minimal in larvae carrying either the temperature sensitive ecdysone
deficient late larval lethal allele ecd1, or l(1)t187, a deep orange
allele known to be deficient in the ecdysone response. However,
experiments with the late larval lethal Broad-Complex mutant l(1)t435 show
that the regulation of this response is distinct from the developmental
ecdysone regulated hierarchies.
