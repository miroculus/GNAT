During the past five years, a growing number of serine-threonine kinases
highly homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ipl1p kinase have been
isolated in various organisms. A Drosophila melanogaster homologue,
aurora, was the first to be isolated from a multicellular organism. Since
then, several related kinases have been found in mammalian cells. They
localise to the mitotic apparatus: in the centrosome, at the poles of the
bipolar spindle or in the midbody. The kinases are necessary for
completion of mitotic events such as centrosome separation, bipolar
spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. Extensive research is now
focusing on these proteins because the three human homologues are
overexpressed in various primary cancers. Furthermore, overexpression of
one of these kinases transforms cells. Because of the myriad of kinases
identified, we suggest a generic name: Aurora/Ipl1p-related kinase (AIRK).
We denote AIRKs with a species prefix and a number, e.g. HsAIRK1.
