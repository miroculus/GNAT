Genes influencing body weight and composition and serum concentrations of
leptin, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in nonfasting
animals were mapped in an intercross of the extreme high-growth mouse line
DU6i and the inbred line DBA/2. Significant loci with major effects (F >
7.07) for body weight, obesity, and muscle weight were found on
chromosomes 1, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, and 17, for leptin on chromosome 14,
for insulin on chromosome 4, and for IGF-I on chromosome 10 at the Igf1
gene locus itself and on chromosome 18. Significant interaction between
different quantitative trait loci (QTL) positions was observed (P < 0.01).
Evidence was found that loci having small direct effect on growth or
obesity contribute to the obese phenotype by gene-gene interaction. The
effects of QTLs, epistasis, and pleiotropy account for 64% and 63% of the
phenotypic variance of body weight and fat accumulation and for over 32%
of muscle weight and serum concentrations of leptin, and IGF-I in the F(2)
population of DU6i x DBA/2 mice. [The quantitative trait loci described in
this paper have been submitted to the Mouse Genome Database.]
