Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutations that cause a requirement for SSD1-v for
viability were isolated, yielding one new gene, LAS1, and three previously
identified genes, SIT4, BCK1/SLK1, and SMP3. Three of these genes, LAS1,
SIT4, and BCK1/SLK1, encode proteins that have roles in bud formation or
morphogenesis. LAS1 is essential and loss of LAS1 function causes the
cells to arrest as 80% unbudded cells and 20% large budded cells that
accumulate many vesicles at the mother-daughter neck. Overexpression of
LAS1 results in extra cell surface projections in the mother cell,
alterations in actin and SPA2 localization, and the accumulation of
electron-dense structures along the periphery of both the mother cell and
the bud. The nuclear localization of LAS1 suggests a role of LAS1 for
regulating bud formation and morphogenesis via the expression of
components that function directly in these processes.
