Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth
factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily. Many BMPs are produced in bone and
show osteogenic activity, suggesting that they may be determinants of bone
mass. BMP3 was originally purified from bone as osteogenin, which induces
osteogenic differentiation. Recombinant BMP3 (rhBMP3) has no biological
activity, however, leaving its role in skeletal growth unclear. Here we
show that BMP3 is an antagonist of osteogenic BMPs: BMP3 dorsalizes
Xenopus laevis embryos, inhibits BMP2-mediated induction of Msx2 and
blocks BMP2-mediated differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells into
osteoblasts. These effects appear to be mediated through activin
receptors. Finally, Bmp3(-/-) mice have twice as much trabecular bone as
wild-type littermates, indicating that BMP3, the most abundant BMP in
adult bone, is a negative determinant of bone density.
