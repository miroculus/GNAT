Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) are crucial regulators of
cell-cycle progression. The CKI Sic1 controls the timing of DNA
replication by inhibiting Clb-Cdc28 kinase. Phosphorylation of Sic1 by
CIn-Cdc28 kinase alleviates this inhibition by targeting Sic1 for
degradation through the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway.
