The Drosophila neurogenic locus mastermind encodes a nuclear protein unusually rich in amino acid homopolymers. The neurogenic loci of Drosophila are required for proper partitioning of ectodermal cells into epidermal versus neural lineages. The loci appear to encode components of a developmental pathway involving cellular communication. In an effort to understand the role of the neurogenic locus mastermind in these processes, we have characterized its expression and sequence. The locus produces a number of transcripts that accumulate ubiquitously during early embryogenesis but more specifically in the central nervous system during later stages. Sequence analysis of a major cDNA product predicts an unusual protein containing an abundance of amino acid homopolymers and charge clusters typical of regulatory molecules. Nearly half of the mass of the predicted protein derives from only three amino acids: glutamine, glycine, and asparagine. Immunohistochemical studies of the protein in cell culture and early embryos show that the protein accumulates predominantly in the nucleus.
