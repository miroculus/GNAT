The polypeptide release factor (eRF1) gene was cloned from rabbit and its
overexpression and purification system was established in parallel with
that of the eRF1 gene of Tetrahymena thermophila that has been cloned
recently in this laboratory. The rabbit eRF1 (Ra-eRF1) is composed of 437
amino acids and is completely identical to human eRF1 though 3% distinct
in the nucleotide sequence. This is in sharp contrast to Tetrahymena eRF1
(Tt-eRF1) that is only 57% identical to human eRF1. The recombinant
Ra-eRF1 was marked with a histidine tag, overexpressed, and purified to
homogeneity by two-step chromatography using Ni-NTA-agarose and Mono Q
columns. In contrast to Ra-eRF1, Tt-eRF1 formed aggregates upon
overexpression in Escherichia coli, hence it was purified under denaturing
conditions, and used to raise rabbit antibody. The resulting anti-Tt-eRF1
antibody proved useful for examining conditions for soluble Tt-eRF1 in
test cells. Finally, a soluble Tt-eRF1 fraction was purified from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformed with the Tt-eRF1 expression plasmid
by three steps of affinity and anion exchange chromatography. The cloned
Ra-eRF1 gene complemented a temperature-sensitive allele in the eRF1 gene,
sup45 (ts), of S. cerevisiae, though the complementation activity was
significantly impaired by the histidine tag, whereas Tt-eRF1 failed to
complement the sup45 (ts) allele.
