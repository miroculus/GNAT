We present a physical and molecular genetic characterization of Drosophila
melanogaster TFIIE (dTFIIE), a component of the basal RNA polymerase II
transcription apparatus. We have purified dTFIIE to near homogeneity from
nuclear extracts of Drosophila embryos and found that it is composed of
two subunits with apparent molecular weights of 55 and 38 kDa. Peptide
sequence information derived from the two subunits was used to isolate the
corresponding cDNA clones, revealing that dTFIIE and human TFIIE share
extensive amino acid similarity. Functional conservation was demonstrated
by the ability of bacterially expressed dTFIIE to substitute for human
TFIIE in an in vitro transcription assay reconstituted from purified
components. Cytological mapping analysis shows that both subunits are
encoded by single copy genes located on chromosome III.
