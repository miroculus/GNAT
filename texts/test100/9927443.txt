The completion of DNA synthesis in yeast is monitored by a checkpoint that
requires MEC1 and RAD53. Here we show that deletion of the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae G1 cyclins CLN1 and CLN2 suppressed the essential requirement
for MEC1 function. Wild-type levels of CLN1 and CLN2, or overexpression of
CLN1, CLN2, or CLB5, but not CLN3, killed mec1 strains. We identified
RNR1, which encodes a subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, as a high-copy
suppressor of the lethality of mec1 GAL1-CLN1. Northern analysis
demonstrated that RNR1 expression is reduced by CLN1 or CLN2
overexpression. Because limiting RNR1 expression would be expected to
decrease dNTP pools, CLN1 and CLN2 may cause lethality in mec1 strains by
causing initiation of DNA replication with inadequate dNTPs. In contrast
to mec1 mutants, MEC1 strains with low dNTPs would be able to delay S
phase and thereby remain viable. We propose that the essential function
for MEC1 may be the same as its checkpoint function during hydroxyurea
treatment, namely, to slow S phase when nucleotides are limiting. In a
cln1 cln2 background, a prolonged period of expression of genes turned on
at the G1-S border, such as RNR1, has been observed. Thus deletion of CLN1
and CLN2 could function similarly to overexpression of RNR1 in suppressing
mec1 lethality.
