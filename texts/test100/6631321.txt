The mutations at the bithorax locus produce a transformation of anterior
haltere into anterior wing. The bx1 allele presents unusual features when
compared with other bx alleles. The phenotype of bx1 homozygotes is
temperature sensitive but only with regard to the distal and not to the
proximal transformation, thus suggesting two different components in the
bithorax transformation. The phenotype of bx1 homozygotes is stronger than
that of bx1 over the deletion of the gene, suggesting a trans interaction
of the bx1 chromosomes which results in mutual partial inactivation. We
show by temperature shift and clonal analysis experiments that the
decision on whether to differentiate haltere or wing structures is taken
at the end of the proliferation period of the mutant disc.
