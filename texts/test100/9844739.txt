A SMT3 cDNA encoding ubiquitin-like protein from Drosophila melanogaster
was isolated and sequenced. Drosophila SMT3 genomic DNA was amplified by
polymerase chain reaction, and its nucleotide sequence was found to be
identical to that of the cDNA, indicating the absence of intron in its
protein coding region. The sequence of 90 amino acids of Drosophila SMT3
exhibited 55%, 73%, 70% and 52% identity to yeast SMT3, human SMT3A, SMT3B
and SMT3C protein.
