A gene (pkt1) was isolated from the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei,
which exhibits high homology with the yeast YPK1 and YKR2 (YPK2) genes. It
contains a 2123-bp ORF that is interrupted by two introns, and it encodes
a 662-amino-acid protein with a calculated M(r) of 72,820. During active
growth, pkt1 is expressed as two mRNAs of 3.1 and 2.8 kb which differ in
the 3' untranslated region due to the use of two different polyadenylation
sites.
