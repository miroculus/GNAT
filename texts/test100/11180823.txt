We have isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding a predicted 524 amino acid
protein from a Drosophila melanogaster ovarian library. Sequence
comparisons suggest that this protein encodes a sodium-dependent inorganic
phosphate co-transporter similar to a sequence isolated from a rat brain
library. In situ hybridisation to messenger RNA in ovaries shows strong
expression in germarium at stage 2 of oogenesis. Expression is then weak
in follicle cells until stage 10, when high transcript levels are seen in
the nurse cells and transferred to the oocyte. This presumably reflects
functions in oogenesis and the production of stored mRNAs for use in
embryogenesis.
