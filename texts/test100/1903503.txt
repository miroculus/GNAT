Region 26A of the second chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster has been
extensively characterized at the genetic level. We report here the cloning
of virtually the entire 26A region via a bidirectional chromosome walk.
Deletion and translocation breakpoints in the 26A interval have been
localized at the molecular level by both chromosomal in situ hybridization
and Southern analysis. The locations of the genetically defined loci in
this chromosomal region have also been correlated with transcriptional
units mapped onto the DNA of the proximal region of the chromosomal walk.
The position of the alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha-Gpdh) gene
in 26A5-7 has been confirmed and a putative transcriptional unit for the
beta-galactosidase-1 (beta-Gal-1) gene has been identified in the 26A7-9
interval.
