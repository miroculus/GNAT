The mouse Brachyury (T) gene is required for normal development of axial
structures. Embryos homozygous for the T mutation show severe deficiencies
in mesoderm formation. They lack the notochord and allantois, have
abnormal somites, and die at approximately 10 days postcoitum probably as
a result of the allantois defect. Mice heterozygous for the T mutation
exhibit a variable short-tailed phenotype. The T gene has been cloned and
shown to be expressed in the tissues most strongly affected by the
mutation. In this paper, we show that a single-copy transgene representing
the wild-type T allele is able to rescue the T-associated tail phenotype.
In addition, we show that increasing dosage of the T gene in Tc/+ mice
causes an increased extension of the axis. These data show the correlation
of the level of T product with the extension of the anteroposterior axis,
directly demonstrating the involvement of the T product in this process.
