Dominant megacolon (Dom) is one of four mutations in the mouse that can
produce a phenotype similar to Hirschsprung disease in human. The Dom gene
product is not known, and no candidate region has been defined for a
possible human homolog. In this publication we report mapping the Dom
locus with high definition, using several intra-and interspecific crosses
and a set of 16 Chr 15-specific microsatellites flanking this locus.
