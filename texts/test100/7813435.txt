In virtually all eukaryotes the centromeric regions of chromosomes are
composed of heterochromatin, a specialized form of chromatin that is rich
in repetitive DNA sequences and is transcriptionally relatively silent.
The Drosophila GAGA transcription factor binds to GA/CT-rich sequences in
many Drosophila promoters, where it activates transcription, apparently by
locally altering chromatin structure and allowing other transcription
factors access to the DNA. Here we report the paradoxical finding that
GAGA factor is associated with specific regions of heterochromatin at all
stages of the cell cycle. A subset of the highly repetitive DNA sequences
that make up the bulk of heterochromatin in D. melanogaster are GA/CT-rich
and we find a striking correlation between the distribution of GAGA factor
and this class of repeat. We propose that GAGA factor binds directly to
these repeats and may thereby play a role in modifying heterochromatin
structure in these regions. Our observations demonstrate for the first
time that a transcriptional regulator can associate with specific DNA
sequences in a fully condensed mitotic chromosome. This may help explain
how the distinctive character of a committed or differentiated cell can be
maintained during cell proliferation.
