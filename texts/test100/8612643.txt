Glutathione (L-gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine, GSH) plays an important
role in the protection of plants against various types of stress caused by
reactive oxygen species, gazeous pollutants, heavy metals and xenobiotics.
A cDNA fragment containing the entire coding unit for glutathione
synthetase (GSH2) of Arabidopsis thaliana was cloned by complementation of
the methylglyoxal sensitivity of a gsh2 mutant of the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. The cDNA encodes a protein of 478 amino acids (deduced Mr:
53783), bearing clear sequence similarities to GSH2 products from frog
embryos (Xenopus laevis), rat kidney (Rattus norvegicus) and from the
fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). A highly conserved glycine-rich
domain close to the carboxy-terminus was found in the GSH2 product and
appears to be typical for eukaryotic glutathione synthetases. The Mr is
similar to those of soluble animal enzymes, suggesting that the
Arabidopsis gene also codes for a cytosolic protein. Genomic DNA-blot
analysis indicates the presence of a single GSH2 gene. The yeast gsh2
mutant becomes resistant to methylglyoxal and cadmium after transformation
with the plasmid bearing the Arabidopsis GSH2 cDNA. Moreover, this
increased resistance is correlated to the restoration of GSH content from
below detectability in mutants to about 50% of the wild-type levels in
transformed cells.
