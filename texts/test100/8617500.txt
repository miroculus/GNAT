Cloning of the human SIX1 gene and its assignment to chromosome 14.

The recently described murine homeobox genes, Six1 and Six2, which are
expressed during development in limb tendons, have also been shown to be
expressed in skeletal and smooth muscle, respectively. We have cloned and
sequenced a human SIX1 cDNA and shown by Northern blotting that it is
expressed in adult skeletal muscle. The cDNA sequence and predicted
protein sequence of SIX1 and Six1 are highly homologous, with 98%
similarity over the entire predicted amino acid sequence. SIX1 was mapped
to human chromosome 14 using a rodent/human somatic cell hybrid panel.
