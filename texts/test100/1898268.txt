Reverse transcription and cDNA amplification (polymerase chain reaction)
of total RNA preparations were used to characterize the expression of EGF
mRNA in the mandibular arch of day 9-17 mouse embryos. EGF mRNA was
present in mandibles at day 9 and 10 but not at days 11-17. Separate RNA
preparations from epithelium and mesenchyme at day 10 revealed EGF mRNA in
both components.
