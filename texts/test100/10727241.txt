Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors are attached to newly
synthesized proteins in the ER by a transamidation reaction during which a
C-terminal GPI attachment signal is replaced by a preformed GPI precursor
lipid. This reaction depends on GAA1 and GPI8, the latter belonging to a
novel cysteine protease family. Homologies between this family and other
Cys proteinases, such as caspases, pointed to Cys199 and His157 as
potential active site residues. Indeed, gpi8 alleles mutated at Cys199 or
His157 are nonfunctional, i.e., they are unable to suppress the lethality
of Deltagpi8 mutants. The overexpression of these nonfunctional alleles in
wild-type cells leads to the accumulation of the free GPI precursor lipid
CP2, delays the maturation of the GPI protein Gas1p, and arrests cell
growth. The dominant negative effect of the Cys199 mutant cannot be
overcome by the simultaneous overexpression of Gaa1p. Most GPI8 alleles
mutated in other conserved regions of the protein can complement the
growth defect of Deltagpi8, but nevertheless accumulate CP2. CP2
accumulation, a delay in Gas1p maturation and a slowing of cell growth can
also be observed when Gpi8p is depleted to 50% of its normal level in
wild-type cells. The dominant negative effect of nonfunctional and
partially functional mutant alleles can best be explained by assuming that
Gpi8p works as part of a homo- or heteropolymeric complex.
